This protocol is intended as a lightweight UDP based protocol for streaming sensor data, and for IOT networks.

The essential idea behind it is the separation of the control and data communications into separate planes with different topologies.

The detailed design document can be found in PDF format on this repository.

I intend to eventually produce a Java implementation, although I may be prevented from doing so by time constraints.
